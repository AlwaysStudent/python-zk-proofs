# python-zk-proofs

This was first created as part of [ECE/CS 598AM Cryptocurrency Security](http://soc1024.ece.illinois.edu/teaching/ece598am/fall2016/
) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

This file contains several examples of zero-knowledge proof schemes (specifically, Sigma protocols), implemented in python.

This code uses Jeremy Kun's beautiful [python library for elliptic curves and finite fields](https://github.com/j2kun/elliptic-curves-finite-fields). Alternatives like `gmpy` would be feasible as well.
